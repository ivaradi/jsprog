Must before release:

- a unique application icon
- a better joystick icon for the indicator bar
- Debian/Ubuntu packages and automatic build
- user's guide
- Hungarian translation
- profiles for my controllers with proper pictures

Other:

- grabbing and moving shift states left-right
- allow to extend an action to the next shift states
- call on the D-Bus interface to quit
- put tooltip text on (almost) everything
- mnemonic keys should be unique
- perhaps highlight virtual controls and shift states in the
  profiles editor
- call add_trasient_for for dialogs
- eliminate isinstance calls
- support for joystick type-specific indicator icons
