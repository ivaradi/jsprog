- support showing and editing other action types.
- grabbing and moving shift states left-right
- allow to extend an action to the next shift states
- when the currently downloaded profile is modified, mark it differently
- value range handlers should also be used for axes (and be able to edit in
  the action editor) - maybe divide up the axis' row into the ranges
  as for the states of a virtual control
- call on the D-Bus interface to quit
- sanity check on virtual control and shift state editing
- generate a unique internal ID for new virtual controls and
  use the display name for hiding the joystick's controls
  instead of the name - or do not hide any controls, just mark the
  ones with duplicate names accordingly. when loading the type and
  the profiles any VC with an ID that is also present in the joystick type
  should be either considered invalid or the VC in the profile should be
  discarded
- handle the case when a virtual control is removed and it is
  referenced from a shift state or a virtual control of a profile
  (possibly, it should not be allowed)
  if it is referred to from a control profile, confirmation should be
  asked
