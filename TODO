Must before release:

- Hungarian translation
- profiles for my controllers with proper pictures
- check support for Lua 5.3 and 5.4
- mnemonic keys should be unique

Other:

- user's guide
- grabbing and moving shift states left-right
- allow to extend an action to the next shift states
- perhaps highlight virtual controls and shift states in the
  profiles editor
- call add_trasient_for for dialogs
- eliminate isinstance calls
