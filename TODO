- support showing and editing other action types.
- grabbing and moving shift states left-right
- allow to extend an action to the next shift states
- when the currently downloaded profile is modified, mark it differently
- value range handlers should also be used for axes (and be able to edit in
  the action editor) - maybe divide up the axis' row into the ranges
  as for the states of a virtual control
- call on the D-Bus interface to quit
- sanity check on virtual control and shift state editing
- if the display name of a physical control is cleared, the identifier
  should be reinstated
- a "default" action should be editable if it is not a real
  default action (e.g. it has key released states only)
- the label for a shift level state should always be displayed in the center
- the tooltip of a virtual state removal button should display
  information about the impossibility of the removal
- when removing the virtual state of a shift level and its column is not empty,
  a warning should be displayed about it as well
